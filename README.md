## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes the following key metrics and visualizations:

- **Total Calls**: Displays the overall count of calls handled by the call center.
- **Total Agents**: Shows the number of active agents.
- **Answered Calls**: Indicates the number of calls successfully answered by agents.
- **Rejected Calls**: Displays the count of calls that were not answered.
- **Resolved Calls**: Tracks the number of calls that were resolved successfully.
- **Unresolved Calls**: Shows the calls that remained unresolved, helping to assess resolution rates.

### Visual Breakdown

1. **Answered Calls and Rejected Calls by Agent**: A bar chart that shows the distribution of answered and rejected calls per agent, helping to compare agent performance.

2. **Performance of Calls by Agent**: Displays the performance of each agent based on the number of answered and resolved calls, aiding in evaluating agent efficiency.

3. **Average Speed of Answer in Seconds**: A gauge chart showing the average time taken to answer calls, indicating response efficiency.

4. **Average Satisfaction Rating by Agent**: A donut chart that visualizes the average customer satisfaction rating for each agent, giving insight into service quality.

5. **Total Calls by Topic**: A breakdown of total calls by different topics (e.g., Streaming, Technical Support, Payment Related) with resolved and unresolved status, enabling analysis of call type frequency and resolution status.

### Technical Details

This dashboard was developed using key features of Power BI, including:
